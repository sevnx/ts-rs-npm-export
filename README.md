# ts-rs-npm-export

Export your Rust TypeScript bindings generated by [ts-rs](https://crates.io/crates/ts-rs).

This crate just creates a `index.d.ts` file that exports all the TypeScript bindings generated by `ts-rs`, with the added benefits of having paths that match the bindings hierarchy. It also creates a `package.json` file with the necessary fields to publish the bindings to npm.
